# Experiment Code 
Repository for preprint: Mole et al. (2020). _Drivers use active gaze to monitor waypoints during automated driving_

Experiment conducted in Vizard 5.2. 32bit.

The experiment relies on the following repositories. These should be cloned to a *shared_modules* folder in the same root directory as the experiment folder:

- For wheel automation the experiment relies on scripts in repo https://github.com/callummole/LogiWheel_Automation

- For eye tracking the experiment relies on https://github.com/OscartGiles/pupil/tree/venlab_udp_thread

- Textures are hosted at https://github.com/callummole/textures

The main script for running the experiment is **Trout18_main.py**. 

The bulk of the experiment design and organisation is conducted in **vizTrialManager.py**
